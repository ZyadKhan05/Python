Carroll Community College: CIS-105-75: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming 

Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming introduces students to programming using objectoriented principles, such as objects, methods and inheritance to write programs. Students will learn 
how to create decision statements, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, sets, objects and classes to 
construct algorithms and solve problems

Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Use decision statements in a program (PG5).
2. Use loops to manipulate data (PG5).
3. Create, call and return data from classes and functions (PG5).
4. Read and or write data to a file (PG5).
5. Write code to handle program exceptions (PG2, PG5).
6. Create and use data storage structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets (PG5).
7. Understand recursive algorithms and their use in problem solving (PG2).
8. Debug code by fixing syntax and logical errors (PG2).
9. Explain how a program works by going through the code line by line (GE1, PG1, PG2, PG4,
PG5)
