#Module for Lab #8, problem #3 problem by Rob Brown/Maria Burness. 
#Class Information already exists with team name, home city, and sport played
#attributes. It also contains all setters/getters for those attributes.

# You will need to create a subclass based on this defined class in this module
# with getters and setters. 
# You will need to upload your revised module file along with the other file
# for this lab problem.
